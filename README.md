# Demand table for China in terms of Basic curation project

Scripts for 2 versions of China Demand table: in Oracle and in GCP. Tables must be equal, excepting the field with Delivery fee which only exists in GCP.

Oracle version is a temporary one, created for validation, because GCP currently has issue with source data (Atomic). Once issues in GCP will be resolved, GCP version of China Demand must be reloaded and validated against Oracle version. Oracle version currently can be validated against Oracle Atomic and AS/400
